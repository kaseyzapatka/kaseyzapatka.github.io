I am a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer in the Department of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. I hold a PhD in Sociology from the City University of New York, The Graduate Center.

My research examines urban inequality through the lens of housing, neighborhoods, and socioeconomic stratification. I have published studies on the [sequence of gentrification](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0042098020940596), the benefits of New York City’s [rent regulation for stabilized tenants](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15356841221123762), and patterns of [neighborhood diversification in immigrant cities](https://www.kaseyzapatka.com/publication/russell-sage/).

Current projects include evaluating the impact of Emergency Rental Assistance distributed during the COVID-19 Pandemic on eviction filing rates using multilevel and machine learning techniques; assessing the effects of eviction moratoria with augmented synthetic controls; and applying spatial econometric techniques to identify spillover effects of gentrification on neighborhood affordability. 

Methodologically, I specialize in quantitative approaches to spatial, survey, and cross-sectional data and teach [a year-long course in computational social science](https://github.com/kaseyzapatka/Computational-Social-Science-Training-Program) to PhD students at UC Berkeley, that covers machine learning, natural language processing, and causal inference techniques.

I am also committed to public-facing scholarship. I developed [Housing Literacy](https://housingliteracynyc.org), a web-based tool to explain New York City’s rent regulation laws, and the [Superdiveristy Website and Teaching Tool](http://www.superdiv-newyork.mmg.mpg.de/#newyork-intro?bubble;filter:Total%20population?map;variables:0,0;mode:traditional?treePermanent;year:2012;category:Family?treeTemporary;year:2012;category:Students?sankey;year:2018?dashboard;filters:Total%20-%20Sex,Total%20-%20Age%2018%20to%2065,Total%20-%20Race-ethnicity,Total%20-%20Immigrant%20cohort,Total%20-%20NYC%20status), which visualizes the changing diversity of metropolitan New York.
