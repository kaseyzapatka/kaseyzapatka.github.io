### University of California, Berkeley  
**Postdoctoral Lecturer**  
*Computational Social Science 1*
- **Reproducibility and transparency** — examen the principles of open and reproducible research, version control, and best practices for documenting and sharing data and analysis 
- **Ethics and critical evaluation** — examining bias, fairness, and limitations of computational methods in social research
- **Machine learning foundations** — supervised learning (regression, classification, tree-based methods, ensemble methods, BART, deep learning), unsupervised learning (clustering, PCA/dimensionality reduction), and ensemble methods
- **Applied social science projects** — 4 hands-on analyses of real-world datasets, including predictive modeling and policy-relevant applications using key Python libraries(e.g., `sklearn`, `numpy` and `matplotlib`), the Anaconda framework, and GitHub.

*Computational Social Science 2*
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** — text as data, fundamentals of text analysis, unsupervised and supervised methods, classification, vector models, neural networks, and transformer models for natural language processing
- **Causal inference** — randomized experiments, DAGs, matching methods, natural experiments, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, synthetic controls, and regression discontinuity designs
- **Sensitivity and robustness analysis** — evaluating assumptions, performing sensitivity checks, and interpreting causal estimates in observational and experimental data
